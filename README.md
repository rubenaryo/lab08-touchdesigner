## Final Result
![](null2.png)

Let's get introduced to TouchDesigner. For this week's lab our main focus is just getting TouchDesigner installed, dealing with licensing issues/potential problems, and becoming more familiar with how the UI and basic operators work.

## 1. Downloading Touchdesigner & Getting Set Up
First, go to this link and download TD if you haven't already: https://derivative.ca/download. Create an account for Derivative in order to login to TD when you open it for the first time. Once TD is open, login using your details and click "Create a New Key" in order to have your free license verified.
## 2. Creating a Slit-Scan Effect using TOPs
In class, this process was demoed so if you were able to follow along, modify the project as you see fit. Think about how gradients, ramps, and toolbox functions can be used to modify your visual output.

If you were not in class today, please follow this short video of me giving an overview of the node network and create it as you see fit.
